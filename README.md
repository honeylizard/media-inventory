# Media Inventory App

An app to catalog physical and digital media from a household into a central inventory system.

## Purpose

As a family, we tend to rummage through the clearance racks of Blu-rays and browse online sales for video games. This creates a problem for us in that we can't always keep track of which movies and games we have already bought.

This will be an application that contains the set of movies and video games that we have in our household currently. It will have the ability to filter the set so that we can find them easily and help determine if we have already purchased them or not.

## Initial Concept

This app will contain a central list of video games and a central list of movies/tv shows. There will be an interface that allows a user to search the list and receive a result based on their search criteria (e.g. do we have that movie already?).

This app should be built so that a user can access the search feature from a mobile device or web browser.
